# ChatGPT-Clone-MacOS-Build
In this project, we have developed a macOS software build framework that mimics the behavior of ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI. The framework is designed to facilitate the development and deployment of conversational AI systems, enabling researchers and developers to build powerful chatbots and virtual assistants with ease.
